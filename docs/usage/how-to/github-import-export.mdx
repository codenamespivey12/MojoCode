description: Learn how to import existing GitHub repositories into OpenHands and export your OpenHands projects to new GitHub repositories.

OpenHands allows you to easily work with GitHub repositories by importing them into your workspace and exporting your projects to new repositories on GitHub.

## Prerequisites

Before using the import/export features, ensure you have:
1.  Connected your GitHub account to OpenHands. You can do this in **Settings > Git Integration**.
2.  For exporting, ensure OpenHands has the necessary permissions to create repositories on your behalf. This is typically granted during the GitHub App installation or OAuth consent.

## Importing a GitHub Repository

You can clone any public GitHub repository directly into your OpenHands workspace. This is useful for bringing in existing codebases to work with.

1.  **Navigate to Settings:** Go to the main settings area of the application.
2.  **Select Git Integration:** Open the Git integration or Git settings tab.
3.  **Find the "Import GitHub Repository" Section:**
    *   You will see an input field labeled "GitHub Repository URL (HTTPS)".
4.  **Enter the Repository URL:**
    *   Paste the full HTTPS URL of the GitHub repository you wish to import (e.g., `https://github.com/someuser/somerepo.git`). The URL must end with `.git`.
5.  **Click "Import Repository":**
    *   OpenHands will clone the repository into your user-specific workspace.
    *   You'll receive a notification once the import is complete. The repository will then be available in your workspace, typically at a path like `your_workspace_root/somerepo`.

## Exporting a Project to a New GitHub Repository

You can take a project from your OpenHands workspace and publish it as a new repository on your connected GitHub account.

1.  **Navigate to Settings:** Go to the main settings area of the application.
2.  **Select Git Integration:** Open the Git integration or Git settings tab.
3.  **Find the "Export Project to New GitHub Repository" Section:**
    *   You will see fields for:
        *   **New GitHub Repository Name:** The name for your new repository on GitHub (e.g., `my-new-openhands-project`).
        *   **Project Path in Workspace:** The path to your project within your OpenHands workspace, relative to your workspace root (e.g., if your project is at `/workspace/your_user_id/my_project_folder`, you would enter `my_project_folder`).
        *   **Repository Description (Optional):** A brief description for your new GitHub repository.
        *   **Private Repository:** Check this box if you want the new GitHub repository to be private. It will be public by default.
4.  **Fill in the Details:** Provide the required information.
5.  **Click "Export to New GitHub Repo":**
    *   OpenHands will:
        1.  Initialize a Git repository in your specified project path (if it's not already one).
        2.  Commit all current files in that project.
        3.  Create a new repository on your GitHub account with the specified name, description, and privacy setting.
        4.  Push your project's files to the new GitHub repository.
    *   You'll receive a notification upon completion, usually including a link to the newly created GitHub repository.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Import Failed:**
    *   Ensure the URL is correct, publicly accessible, and ends with `.git`.
    *   Check for network issues.
*   **Export Failed:**
    *   Ensure the Project Path in Workspace is correct and the project exists.
    *   Verify that OpenHands has permission to create repositories for your GitHub account.
    *   The chosen repository name might already exist or be invalid. Try a different name.
